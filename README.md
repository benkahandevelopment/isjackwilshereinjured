# is.jackwilshereinjured.com

So after a discussion with a colleague, we decided the best way to ascertain exactly whether or not Jack Wilshere was, at any moment in time, ruled to the sidelines with injury was to create a website with a sole purpose of distributing said information.

Hence, <a href="https://is.jackwilshereinjured.com/" target="_blank">`is.jackwilshereinjured.com`</a> was born.
